## Artist statement 

### [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com) 
I make paintings, performances, books, and installations. I make unique computational objects, as in my Handmade Computer series and Distributed Network of Care, a new generation of secure, non-commercial and censorship-free networks. I explore the discourse of technology with a critical perspective towards ethics, agency, justice and sensitivity to minority issues. I consider technology as means of effecting power and seek to make tools and resources accessible to those excluded in consumerist technology’s concept of personhood. As a social practice artist, I’m inspired by art as a form of care. I draw from the work of Lygia Clark and Suzanne Lacy, whose social practices prompt direct action, participation and educational engagement. Through my work and teaching, I attempt to practice soft care, an implicit, nuanced form of care between people and within oneself that prioritize one’s personhood and integrity as well as their security and privacy. I investigate how technological innovation is not an inherent good for the people, because care cannot be entirely automated.
