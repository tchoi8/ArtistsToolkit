Students will learn to frame their creative practices as art by completing tasks such as writing critically about their own work, drafting grant proposals, and planning the business administration of their studios. By the end of class, students will complete their artist portfolio website and apply for an artist residency.

- What do you spend time doing that influences your practice?
- Who are some artists that inspire your practice?
- What are some artist movements that inspire your practice?
- Who do you make work for, who is your primary audience?
- Are there any values that are important to your practice? What are they?
- What do you hope your work will accomplish aesthetically, conceptually?

### [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com) 
I make paintings, performances, books, and installations. I make unique computational objects, as in my Handmade Computer series and Distributed Network of Care, a new generation of secure, non-commercial and censorship-free networks. I explore the discourse of technology with a critical perspective towards ethics, agency, justice and sensitivity to minority issues. I consider technology as means of effecting power and seek to make tools and resources accessible to those excluded in consumerist technology’s concept of personhood. As a social practice artist, I’m inspired by art as a form of care. I draw from the work of Lygia Clark and Suzanne Lacy, whose social practices prompt direct action, participation and educational engagement. Through my work and teaching, I attempt to practice soft care, an implicit, nuanced form of care between people and within oneself that prioritize one’s personhood and integrity as well as their security and privacy. I investigate how technological innovation is not an inherent good for the people, because care cannot be entirely automated.
