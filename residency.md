Artist residencies offer great opportunities for emerging artists to develop their artistic practice. It's also a chance to find a community of collaborators and build a network with curators. Applying to artist residencies can be a daunting task at first. This workshop will give an overview of residencies and provide practical tips to applications. Students will write their artist statement, narrative bio and prepare their supporting documents. 




# Why do I need to apply for Artist residency? 
- Time and space. Usually free space + professional development 
- Network, connection and exposure 
- Build a relation with a city or a community  
- Chance to intervene in the wheelhouse of MFA and the contemporary fine arts network, curator, writer, gallerist, etc  
- Opportunity for new ideas, inspiration, collaboration
- Support structure for your practice.  
- When you have money, you don't have time. When you have time, you don't have money. Sometimes you don't have money or time.

You meet great friends and collaborators at residencies. 

# Making a living / Making good work
- Survival tactic: Diversify your source of income 
- Working for other artists? Access to connections? 
- Do not over commit or over produce (doing mulitple residencies at the same time is a bad idea) 
- We will never have enough time or resources. Deal with it. (Think of your reality as a creative constraint, not a restriction) 
- I highly recommend [B.F.A](https://lmcc.net/artist-resources/professional-development-for-artists/)(Basic Finance for Artists) at LMCC, and the [Creative Capital](https://www.creative-capital.org/pdp)'s professional development programs and webinars. 
- [Art/Work](http://books.simonandschuster.com/ART-WORK/Heather-Darcy-Bhandari/9781416572336) is a a great resrouce. 

# Promise me this 

- Create your own residency, $5000 grant for yourself. 17 months plan - save $300 every months from this month. By September 6, 2019. You will have $5000 for your creative work. This is your seed money. Invest in your own practice and your team. 

- Apply to 5 artist resiencies in next 12 months. 

- Host 1 artist in residence in next 6 months. 

# Residency/ Fellowship/ Commission 
- Expectations and experiences are different. Fellowship often focus on programs and professional developments, Commission focus on making one big project, often with financial support. Residency focus on supporting your practice, for you to make art. Residencies often only expect you to use the space and exhibiting work in progress during the open studios. 
- Institutional / Artists-run Spaces
- Residencies that pay you 
- Residencies that are free
- Residencies that you pay 
- This all depends on how the residencies are funded and structured. 

# Domestic / International / Nomadic

# Them. Selection process

# Rejection, Interview, Acceptance
- Don’t feel bad. It’s not you, it’s them. 
- Keep record of your rejections. Next year, if you apply again, mention what has changed in your practice since the last application.  
-  Follow up. Ask if they can give advise for you to apply next time, see who got the residency 
-  It gets easier. If you apply for a few times, you have a body of text and images to use. I apply to about 1~2 residencies and commisions per month. 
- Interview: Great, you are one of the finalist. What to do in an interview? Talk about what you are working on right now. And what this opportunity will mean for you.
- What to do when you are in the residency - fair balance of making work and networking 
- Thank them. After all, they work for us, the artists. 
- If you are accepted, YEAH! Make sure to block out some time and mind space, so you can concentrate on your work during the residency. This is where your residency fund become useful.
